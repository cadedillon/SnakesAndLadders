# SnakesAndLadders
A Console application game of Snakes and Ladders!

I was very excited to work on this because as a kid I loved playing Snakes and Ladders with my friends.
The rules of the game are simple, at the start of each player's turn two dice are rolled, and the player
moves along the board according to the results. If the player lands on a space with a snake or a ladder, 
they will be moved up or down the length of the snake or ladder. If the player goes over 100, they will 'bounce back'
the amount of spaces they went over. First player to 100 wins!

The map for the board can be found at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adrianeyre/codewars/master/Ruby/Authored/snakesandladdersboard.jpg
